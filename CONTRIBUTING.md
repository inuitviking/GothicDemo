If you want to contribute, here are some steps:
	1. If you see an error, you can give a fix.
	2. If you think something can be improved, either promote with a branch or send a mail to admin@ivikk.net.
	3. Heck, as long as you think you can make this a good thing, and it's relevant to the project, I'd love to see it.

Code of conduct can be found here https://github.com/inuitviking/GothicDemo/blob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md

Unfortunately, I don't have a documentation for this, but I do expect you to be nice to whomever may have done anything on this for-fun project.
