# EVERYTHING IS MOVED TO GITLAB

# GothicDemo
This is a demo site that I am working on.
It has to use gothic fonts and seem somewhat old schoolish, but not be resource heavy, so a ton of pictures is not an option.
It also has to be mobile friendly and easy to use for both normal functioning people and disabled people.
